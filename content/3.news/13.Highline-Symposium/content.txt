The High Line is a public park built on an historic freight rail line elevated above the streets on Manhattan's West Side. We've just designed this newspaper for the High Line Symposium at the [Garden Museum](http://www.gardenmuseum.org.uk/), which includes the co-founders of the High Line Joshua David and Robert Hammond's first talk about the project in Europe.
