We've designed a submission for [6&#215;6](http://www.6x6letterpress.co.uk/), a collaborative letterpress project between staff and students from six colleges across the country. This woodblock font has been in the Camberwell letterpress department long before any of the current staff and no one knows its origin. We thought this would be a good opportunity to put a call out to see if anyone can tell us where it's from. Please let us know if you recognise it.
