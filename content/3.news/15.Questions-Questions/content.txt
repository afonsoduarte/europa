We wrote a text for the book *[Questions/Questions â€“ On art & design education](http://questionsslashquestions.tumblr.com/)*, called 'How to get a free lunch from the rector (and David Hockney)' about what happened on our last day at the Royal College of Art in 2007. The book is edited by Charlotte Cheetham and Samuel Bonnet.
