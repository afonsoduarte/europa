Our students at Camberwell have an exhibition called Invisible Structures on 18 and 19 June at 47-49 Tanner Street SE1 3PL. Join us at the opening on Tuesday night, from 6pm and have a look at the list of events on the [website](http://www.invisiblestructures.net). The poster above was brilliantly designed by Eilis Searson.
