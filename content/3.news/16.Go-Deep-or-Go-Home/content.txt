We've made a sign and some beermats for an exhibition called [Go Deep or Go Home](http://vimeo.com/53108802) at A.S.C. Gallery. The exhibition is curated but The Hut Project and includes work by Vanessa Billy, Rachal Bradley, Chris Evans, Sara Nunes Fernandes, Ryan Gander, Will Holder, Kevin Logan, Alek O, Sam Porritt, Matthew Richardson and Jack Strange. Our contributions were made with [Eric Palm√©r](http://cargocollective.com/ericpalmer).
