We've just launched a new identity for The Project Room which we worked on with [Martin Frostner Studio](http://www.martinfrostner.se). The Project Room, at the [Swedish Museum of Architecture](http://www.arkitekturmuseet.se/index.xml?CookieIsSet=true) in Stockholm, is a new space which facilitates design and craft projects with a relationship to architecture and urban design. The current exhibition is Johanna Hellgren's *Careful Companion*.
