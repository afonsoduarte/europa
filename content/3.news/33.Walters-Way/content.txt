As part of Into the Fold in the Camberwell Space we will be taking participants on a visit to Walters Way in Honour Oak Park. Walters Way is a series of thirteen houses that were built by the people who were to live in them using the architect [Walter Segal](http://www.segalselfbuild.co.uk/news/waltersegalbycol.html)â€™s timber frame construction method. Meet us in the Camberwell Space on Thursday at 10am.
