Gyms purposefully use up energy. Have you ever wondered how that energy could be put to use? [The Good Gym](http://www.goodgym.org/) is a group of people who get fit by doing physical tasks which benefit the community. Their exercise routines range from shifting rubble and planting gardens to making deliveries and visits to elderly people. We designed this poster for The Good Gym which you can still see on Bethnal Green Road.
