title: FANTASTIC FACTOLOGY

content: |
  Located in Londonâ€™s Olympic Park, Fantastic Factology was a project in which facts were submitted by members of the public via the website and on postcards through various workshops. The facts were collected, edited and finally produced as a series of bench plaques which were inset in park benches dispersed throughout the site, creating a trail of informative morsels covering everything from the sleeping habits of the snail to the structure of the Mongolian language.
